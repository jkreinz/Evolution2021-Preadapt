# Evolution2021-Preadapt

## Phenotype data and scripts for Kreiner et al., Evolution2021 - Selective ancestral sorting and de novo evolution in the agricultural invasion of _Amaranthus tuberculatus_

### Data: 

[Common Garden Phenotypes](https://github.com/jkreinz/Evolution2021-Preadapt/blob/main/Common%20Garden%20Phenotypes) - Phenotypes measured across 6000 individuals in the manipulative common garden experiment 


### Scripts:

[R script for generating Table 1, Figure 4, and Figure 3](https://github.com/jkreinz/Evolution2021-Preadapt/blob/main/Table1%2C%20Figure%203%2C%20Figure%204.Rmd) - Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models of 11 focal phenotypes, phenotype visualizations against longitude, latitude, ancestry, and environment, and plasticity visualizations 

[R script for generating Figure 5 and related analyses](https://github.com/jkreinz/Evolution2021-Preadapt/blob/main/Treatment%20by%20ancestry%2C%20Figure%205%20inference.R) - Tests for preadaptation (ancestry by treatment interaction), de novo adaptation (environmental effects), and hybrid vigour (non-linear ancestry effects). Analysis done at the family mean within treatment level, seperately across sexes.
